# The Anomalies ML System
The Anomalies ML System is a consumer data management system to determine preferences which are leveraged to create customer recommendations and a hospitality personalization widget within existing CRM systems. We focused on identifying a strong solution to the issue Hilton executives identified with personalization and inadequate utilization of data, and delivering a functional MVP with minimal utilization of mockups.
